# Kevzam

Kevzam is a social media platform focused on rich interactions between followers. Users can share ephemeral stories and video posts, converse through direct messages, and mention friends across the app.

## Features

- **Stories**: Upload images or videos and get notified when followers view them.
- **Direct Messages**: Chat in real time and forward any received or sent message to another user by referencing their username.
- **Mentions**: Tag people in posts with @username, sending them both a notification and a direct message.
- **Notifications**: Alerts for story views, mentions, and other interactions keep engagement high.

## Development

This repository hosts a Node.js/React implementation. The backend provides RESTful endpoints, while the frontend offers a responsive interface. To start development, install dependencies and run the respective development servers in the `backend` and `frontend` folders.

Contributions and feedback are welcome.
